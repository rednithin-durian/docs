Hey there! We'd like to welcome you to Durianpay platform. Durianpay provides businesses an easy, modern and user-friendly way to accept payments as well manage payouts from/to their customers. This documentation contains resources you'll need to integrate your website or app with Durianpay APIs and SDKs.

There are two sections to our documentation: [Docs](/docs/) and [API Reference](api/).

Docs are here for both developers, product teams and openrations teams to give a better idea of the underlying concepts behind payments and to also give a general workflow for integration.

The API Reference will go into detail about each individual endpoint. If you are an experienced developer or have integrated payments before, feel free to go directly into detail about each of the APIs.
